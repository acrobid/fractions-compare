Product Requirements Document: Long Division Explorer
1. Introduction

The Long Division Explorer is an interactive educational feature within the Vue 3 application. Its purpose is to provide users with a clear, step-by-step visualization of the long division process. This tool aims to demystify long division by emulating the traditional "graph paper" or "blackboard" method used in elementary education, making it easier for users to understand the mechanics of each step.

2. Target Audience

Students learning long division (e.g., elementary to middle school).
Parents or educators looking for a tool to help teach or reinforce long division concepts.
Anyone needing a refresher on how to perform long division.
3. Goals

Educational Clarity: To provide an accurate and easy-to-understand visual representation of the long division algorithm.
Interactive Learning: To allow users to control the pace of the division process, stepping through it to better grasp each stage.
Engagement: To create a visually appealing and intuitive interface that encourages learning.
Correctness: To ensure the mathematical accuracy of all calculations and steps displayed.
4. Functional Requirements

4.1. Input:
Users must be able to input a positive integer dividend.
Users must be able to input a positive integer divisor.
Input fields should be clearly labeled.
Basic input validation (e.g., ensure inputs are numbers, divisor is not zero).
4.2. Process Initiation:
A "Start Problem" or "Calculate" button to initiate the long division process after inputs are provided.
4.3. Step-by-Step Visualization:
The core feature: display the long division process one step at a time.
Each step should correspond to a single, logical action in the long division algorithm (e.g., "bring down next digit," "multiply quotient digit by divisor," "subtract," "determine next quotient digit").
4.4. Visual Display - "Graph Paper Grid":
The division problem (divisor, dividend, quotient, and all intermediate calculation steps) must be displayed in a clear, grid-like layout, mimicking graph paper.
Each digit should occupy its own "cell" in the grid to ensure proper alignment.
The traditional long division symbol (vinculum and bracket) must be clearly rendered.
Alignment is critical:
Quotient digits must align correctly above the corresponding dividend digits.
Numbers involved in subtraction steps must align vertically by place value.
Intermediate products and subtraction results must be positioned correctly.
4.5. Highlighting and Focus:
The current "active" numbers or section of the problem being worked on in each step should be visually highlighted (e.g., different background color, bolding).
For example, when "bringing down" a digit, that digit and its new position should be highlighted. When multiplying, the current quotient digit and divisor should be highlighted.
4.6. Step Explanation:
A dedicated area on the page should display a concise, plain-language explanation of the current step being shown.
The language should be simple, akin to how an elementary teacher would explain it (e.g., "Now, we see how many times 5 goes into 23," "Next, we multiply 4 by 5," "Then, we subtract 20 from 23," "Let's bring down the next digit, which is 7").
4.7. Controls:
"Next Step" Button: Advances the visualization to the next logical step in the division process. Disabled when the division is complete or not yet started.
"Previous Step" Button (Optional - for V2): Allows users to go back to the previous step.
"Reset" or "New Problem" Button: Clears the current problem and inputs, allowing the user to start over.
"Show Entire Solution" Button (Optional - for V2): Allows users to see the full worked-out problem at once.
4.8. Output:
The final quotient should be clearly displayed in its correct position above the dividend.
The final remainder (if any) should be clearly displayed and labeled.
A summary message indicating the division is complete, along with the final answer (e.g., "423 divided by 23 is 18 with a remainder of 9").
5. Non-Functional Requirements

5.1. Usability:
The interface must be intuitive and self-explanatory.
Visual cues should guide the user effectively.
5.2. Performance:
Calculations should be performed quickly.
Animations/transitions for highlighting and step changes should be smooth and not laggy.
5.3. Responsiveness (Basic):
The layout should be usable on typical desktop screen sizes. Full mobile responsiveness can be a V2 consideration.
5.4. Browser Compatibility:
Should function correctly on modern versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
5.5. Code Maintainability:
The Vue components and logic (especially in useLongDivision.ts) should be well-structured, commented, and easy to understand for future development.
State management should be clean and predictable.
6. Design Considerations (Visual & Interaction)

6.1. "Graph Paper" Aesthetic:
The grid lines should be visible but not overpowering.
Digits should be centered within their grid cells.
Font choice should be clear and legible, suitable for numbers.
6.2. Color Palette:
Use a clean, educational, and accessible color scheme.
Highlighting colors should provide good contrast.
6.3. Animations & Transitions:
Subtle animations can be used to emphasize actions like "bringing down" a digit or a new number appearing.
Transitions between steps should feel fluid.
6.4. Vinculum/Division Bracket:
The division bracket must be rendered accurately and scale appropriately with the length of the dividend.
The horizontal line (vinculum) above the dividend must extend to cover all dividend digits and any subsequent "brought down" digits.
7. Success Metrics

User feedback indicating ease of understanding and helpfulness.
Low error rate in calculations.
Users successfully stepping through entire problems.
(If analytics are implemented) Time spent on page, number of problems attempted.
8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1)

Handling decimal division (dividing until no remainder or to a certain number of decimal places).
Support for larger numbers (beyond typical elementary examples).
Difficulty levels or presets.
Ability to input negative numbers.
Saving or sharing problems.
More advanced accessibility features (e.g., screen reader compatibility for the visual steps).
"Hint" system if a user gets stuck trying to predict the next step.

n will focus on building the feature incrementally, ensuring that each part can be tested along the way.

Overall Approach:

We'll build this from the inside out:

Core Logic: First, implement the long division algorithm and step generation (useLongDivision.ts). This is the brain.
Basic UI Shell: Create the Vue components with placeholder content.
Connecting Logic to UI: Wire up the inputs, controls, and display areas to the core logic.
Dynamic Grid Display: Implement the detailed rendering of the division process in the grid. This is the visual heart.
Styling and Refinements: Polish the look and feel, and ensure all PRD requirements are met.
Implementation Plan for Junior Engineer

Phase 1: Core Long Division Logic (useLongDivision.ts)

Goal: Create a composable that can take a dividend and divisor, and generate a list of all steps involved in long division, including explanations and the state of the numbers at each step.

Task 1.1: Project Setup & File Creation

Ensure your Vue 3 + TypeScript project is set up.
Locate or create the useLongDivision.ts file.
PRD Ref: 5.5
Task 1.2: Define State and Types

Inside useLongDivision.ts, define reactive variables using ref for:
dividend: ref<number | null>(null)
divisor: ref<number | null>(null)
quotient: ref<string>('')
remainder: ref<number | null>(null)
steps: ref<Step[]>([]) (An array to hold each step of the calculation)
currentStepIndex: ref<number>(-1)
isComplete: ref<boolean>(false)
currentExplanation: ref<string>('')
Define interfaces for the structure of a Step and the data needed for the grid display at each step (GridState):
// src/composables/useLongDivision.ts

export interface CalculationLine {
  id: string; // Unique ID for v-for key
  value: string; // The number string, e.g., "123" or "  123" with leading spaces for alignment
  type: 'currentDividendPortion' | 'product' | 'subtractionResult';
  isHighlighted?: boolean;
  // Add any other properties needed for styling or positioning
}

export interface GridState {
  divisorDigits: string[];
  dividendDigits: string[]; // Original dividend
  quotientDigits: string[]; // Digits of the quotient as they are found
  calculationLines: CalculationLine[]; // Lines for products, subtractions
  activeDividendDigits?: { start: number, end: number }; // Range of currently focused dividend digits
  activeQuotientDigitIndex?: number;
  activeCalculationLineId?: string;
  broughtDownDigit?: { value: string, position: number };
}

export interface Step {
  explanation: string;
  gridState: GridState;
  // Intermediate values for easier debugging or more detailed explanation if needed
  workingDividendPortion?: string;
  quotientDigitJustFound?: string;
  product?: string;
  subtractionResult?: string;
}
}
PRD Ref: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8
Task 1.3: setInputs Function

Create a function setInputs(newDividend: number, newDivisor: number):
Updates the dividend and divisor refs.
Performs basic validation (positive integers, divisor not zero). Log errors or throw if invalid.
Resets other state variables (quotient, remainder, steps, currentStepIndex, isComplete, currentExplanation).
PRD Ref: 4.1
Task 1.4: generateSteps Function (The Core Algorithm)

This is the most complex function. It will populate the steps array.
Algorithm Outline:
Initialize:
Clear steps.value.
Convert dividend.value to a string (dividendStr).
Initialize currentQuotientDigits: string[] = [].
Initialize currentCalculationLines: CalculationLine[] = [].
workingPortion = "" (the part of the dividend currently being divided).
dividendIndex = 0.
Initial Step: Add a step explaining the problem setup.
gridState: Show divisor and full dividend.
explanation: "We want to divide [dividend] by [divisor]."
Main Loop (iterate while dividendIndex < dividendStr.length or workingPortion can still be processed for remainder): a. Bring Down Digit(s): * Append digits from dividendStr to workingPortion until parseInt(workingPortion) >= divisor.value or all digits are used. If workingPortion starts empty or as "0", ensure at least one digit is brought down. * Add Step: * explanation: "Bring down '[digit(s)]'. Our new working number is [workingPortion]." * gridState: Update to show the workingPortion highlighted. Show "arrow" or highlight for brought down digit. b. If parseInt(workingPortion) < divisor.value (and all digits brought down): * The current workingPortion is part of the remainder calculation. If currentQuotientDigits is empty, the quotient digit is 0. * If this is the end, workingPortion is the final remainder. c. Determine Quotient Digit: * qDigit = Math.floor(parseInt(workingPortion) / divisor.value). * Add qDigit.toString() to currentQuotientDigits. * Add Step: * explanation: "How many times does [divisor] go into [workingPortion]? It's [qDigit]." * gridState: Show qDigit in the quotient area, highlight it. d. Multiply: * product = qDigit * divisor.value. * Add a new CalculationLine for this product, indented appropriately. * Add Step: * explanation: "Multiply [qDigit] by [divisor] to get [product]." * gridState: Show product under workingPortion, highlight them. e. Subtract: * difference = parseInt(workingPortion) - product. * Add a new CalculationLine for this difference. * Add Step: * explanation: "[workingPortion] minus [product] is [difference]." * gridState: Show difference, highlight. f. Update workingPortion: workingPortion = difference.toString().
Final Remainder Step:
After the loop, the final workingPortion (if not 0) is the remainder.
Set remainder.value.
Set quotient.value = currentQuotientDigits.join('').
Add Step:
explanation: "The division is complete. Quotient is [quotient], Remainder is [remainder]."
gridState: Show final quotient and remainder.
Set isComplete.value = true.
Helper: For gridState in each step, ensure you are creating new objects/arrays (deep copy where necessary) so that each step has its unique state.
PRD Ref: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8
Task 1.5: Control Functions

startProblem():
Calls generateSteps().
If steps.value.length > 0, sets currentStepIndex.value = 0 and updates currentExplanation and other relevant display refs based on the first step.
isComplete.value = false.
nextStep():
Increments currentStepIndex.value if currentStepIndex.value < steps.value.length - 1.
Updates currentExplanation and other display refs based on the new current step.
If currentStepIndex.value is the last step, call a function that finalizes the display (e.g., sets isComplete.value = true if not already set by generateSteps).
resetProblem():
Calls setInputs(null, null) or directly clears all state: dividend.value = null, divisor.value = null, quotient.value = '', remainder.value = null, steps.value = [], currentStepIndex.value = -1, isComplete.value = false, currentExplanation.value = ''.
PRD Ref: 4.2, 4.7
Task 1.6: Export from Composable

Return all reactive state variables and functions that the components will need.
}
Testing: At this stage, you can test useLongDivision.ts independently, perhaps by calling its functions in a test script or a temporary component and console.logging the steps array to verify the logic. Test with simple cases (e.g., 10/2, 7/3, 123/4).

Phase 2: Basic UI Component Shells

Goal: Create the Vue component files with basic templates. No complex logic or styling yet.

Task 2.1: LongDivisionPage.vue (Main Page)

Create LongDivisionPage.vue.
Basic template:
<template>
  <div class="long-division-grid-display">
    <p v-if="!gridState">Grid will appear here once problem starts.</p>
    <pre v-else>{{ gridState }}</pre> <!-- Temporary: just show the data -->
  </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { GridState } from '../composables/useLongDivision'; // Adjust path if needed
defineProps<{ gridState: GridState | null }>();
</script>
<style scoped>
.long-division-grid-display { border: 1px solid #ccc; min-height: 100px; padding: 10px; margin-top:10px; }
pre { white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word; }
</style>
>
PRD Ref: Overall structure.
Task 2.2: DivisionSetup.vue (Input Fields)

Create DivisionSetup.vue.
Template with two number inputs (dividend, divisor) and a "Set Problem" button (or emit on input change).
Emit an event inputs-ready with { dividend, divisor } when inputs are valid and user is ready.
>
    const isValid = computed(() =>
        inputDividend.value !== null && inputDividend.value > 0 &&
        inputDivisor.value !== null && inputDivisor.value > 0
    );

    const submitInputs = () => {
      if (isValid.value && inputDividend.value && inputDivisor.value) {
        emit('inputs-ready', { dividend: inputDividend.value, divisor: inputDivisor.value });
      }
    };
    // Consider emitting automatically on valid input change if preferred UX
    </script>
    <style scoped> /* Basic styling for inputs */ </style>
    ```
*   **PRD Ref:** 4.1
PRD Ref: 4.1
Task 2.3: DivisionControls.vue (Buttons)

Create src/components/DivisionControls.vue.
Template with "Start Problem", "Next Step", "Reset" buttons.
Props: canStart: boolean, canNext: boolean.
Emit events: start-clicked, next-clicked, reset-clicked.
<template>
  <div class="division-controls">
    <button @click="$emit('start-clicked')" :disabled="!canStart">Start Problem</button>
    <button @click="$emit('next-clicked')" :disabled="!canNext">Next Step</button>
    <button @click="$emit('reset-clicked')">Reset</button>
  </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{ canStart: boolean; canNext: boolean }>();
defineEmits(['start-clicked', 'next-clicked', 'reset-clicked']);
</script>
<style scoped> /* Basic button styling */ </style>
>
PRD Ref: 4.2, 4.7
Task 2.4: LongDivisionGridDisplay.vue (Visual Grid - Placeholder)

Create src/components/LongDivisionGridDisplay.vue.
Props: gridState: GridState | null.
Basic template:
>
PRD Ref: 4.4
Task 2.5: LongDivisionStepDetail.vue (Explanation Area)

Create src/components/LongDivisionStepDetail.vue.
Props: explanation: string.
Template: <div class="step-explanation"><p>{{ explanation }}</p></div>
PRD Ref: 4.6
Phase 3: Connecting Logic to UI & Basic Functionality

Goal: Make the buttons work, display step explanations, and show the raw gridState data.

Task 3.1: Wire up LongDivisionPage.vue
Import useLongDivision and the child components.
Instantiate the composable: const { ... } = useLongDivision();.
Implement handler methods (handleInputsReady, onStart, onNext, onReset) that call the respective functions from useLongDivision.
Pass reactive state (e.g., currentGridState, currentStepExplanation, isComplete, finalQuotient, finalRemainder) from the composable to the props of child components.
Manage canStart and canNext computed properties based on the composable's state.
Testing:
Enter dividend/divisor, click "Set Problem".
Click "Start Problem". The explanation for the first step should appear. The <pre> tag in LongDivisionGridDisplay should show the gridState for the first step.
Click "Next Step". Explanation and gridState should update.
Continue until the end. The final summary should appear.
Click "Reset". Everything should clear.
Phase 4: Implementing LongDivisionGridDisplay.vue (The Visual Grid)

Goal: Dynamically render the divisor, dividend, quotient, and calculation steps in a grid format. This is the most visually complex part.

Task 4.1: Grid Structure Planning

Decide on a CSS Grid strategy. You'll need columns for:
Divisor (potentially spanning multiple columns if it's long)
Space for the division bracket's vertical line
Each digit of the dividend/quotient
The number of digit columns will depend on the length of the dividend.
Rows will be needed for: quotient, vinculum, dividend, and multiple calculation lines.
Task 4.2: Rendering Divisor, Dividend, Quotient

In LongDivisionGridDisplay.vue:
Divisor: Display gridState.divisorDigits.join('') to the left.
Division Bracket: Use CSS to create the visual bracket (e.g., a div with borders).
Quotient: Iterate gridState.quotientDigits. Place each digit above the corresponding dividend digit. Use v-for and CSS Grid positioning. Highlight activeQuotientDigitIndex.
Vinculum (Horizontal Line): A div styled with a top border, spanning above the dividend.
Dividend (Original): Iterate gridState.dividendDigits. Place each digit. Highlight activeDividendDigits.
PRD Ref: 4.4, 6.1, 6.4
Task 4.3: Rendering Calculation Lines

Iterate gridState.calculationLines. Each CalculationLine object has value (the number string) and type.
For each line:
The value string might need leading spaces for correct horizontal alignment under the dividend/working portion. These spaces should be calculated in useLongDivision.ts when creating the CalculationLine objects.
Render each digit of line.value in its own grid cell.
Use CSS Grid to position the start of this line correctly.
Highlight activeCalculationLineId.
PRD Ref: 4.4
Task 4.4: Highlighting

Use dynamic CSS classes based on properties in gridState (e.g., activeQuotientDigitIndex, activeDividendDigits, activeCalculationLineId).
Define these CSS classes (e.g., .highlighted-digit { background-color: yellow; }).
PRD Ref: 4.5
Task 4.5: Styling the Grid Cells

Style individual cells to look like "graph paper" (e.g., light borders).
Ensure digits are centered and legible.
PRD Ref: 6.1
Example Snippet for LongDivisionGridDisplay.vue (Conceptual):

Iteration: This task will likely require significant iteration on the CSS and the data structure in GridState to achieve correct alignment. Test with different number lengths.

Phase 5: Styling, Refinements, and Final Testing

Goal: Polish the application, ensure all PRD requirements are met, and perform thorough testing.

Task 5.1: Finalize Styling
Apply the "graph paper" aesthetic (PRD 6.1).
Ensure a clean, educational, and accessible color palette (PRD 6.2).
Refine highlighting and any animations/transitions (PRD 4.5, 6.3).
Ensure the vinculum/division bracket is rendered accurately and scales (PRD 6.4).
Task 5.2: Usability and Clarity
Review all explanations for clarity and simplicity (PRD 4.6).
Ensure the interface is intuitive (PRD 5.1).
Task 5.3: Code Maintainability
Review useLongDivision.ts and all components for clarity, comments, and structure (PRD 5.5).
Task 5.4: Browser Compatibility & Responsiveness
Test on modern browsers (PRD 5.4).
Check basic responsiveness on desktop (PRD 5.3).
Task 5.5: Thorough Testing (PRD 7)
Test various scenarios:
Simple division (e.g., 6 / 2 = 3)
Division with remainder (e.g., 7 / 2 = 3 R 1)
Multi-digit dividend and divisor (e.g., 1234 / 56)
Cases with zeros in dividend or quotient (e.g., 102 / 3 = 34; 400 / 8 = 50)
Dividend smaller than divisor (e.g., 3 / 5 = 0 R 3)
Verify calculations, step-by-step display, explanations, and highlighting for correctness.
Verify control button states and reset functionality.
This detailed plan should provide enough guidance. The junior engineer should tackle one task at a time, focusing on getting the data flow correct first, then the visual representation. Frequent testing and breaking down complex parts (like generateSteps and LongDivisionGridDisplay rendering) into smaller sub-problems will be key.<template> <div class="division-setup"> <label>Dividend: <input type="number" v-model.number="inputDividend" placeholder="e.g., 123"></label> <label>Divisor: <input type="number" v-model.number="inputDivisor" placeholder="e.g., 4"></label> <!-- Button can be removed if emitting on input change after validation --> <button @click="submitInputs" :disabled="!isValid">Set Problem</button> </div> </template> <script setup lang="ts"> import { ref, computed } from 'vue'; const emit = defineEmits(['inputs-ready']); const inputDividend = ref<number |="" null="">(null); const inputDivisor = ref<number |="" null="">(null);</number></number>

Task 5.2: Usability and Clarity
Review all explanations for clarity and simplicity (PRD 4.6).
Ensure the interface is intuitive (PRD 5.1).
Task 5.3: Code Maintainability
Review useLongDivision.ts and all components for clarity, comments, and structure (PRD 5.5).
Task 5.4: Browser Compatibility & Responsiveness
Test on modern browsers (PRD 5.4).
Check basic responsiveness on desktop (PRD 5.3).
Task 5.5: Thorough Testing (PRD 7)
Test various scenarios:
Simple division (e.g., 6 / 2 = 3)
Division with remainder (e.g., 7 / 2 = 3 R 1)
Multi-digit dividend and divisor (e.g., 1234 / 56)
Cases with zeros in dividend or quotient (e.g., 102 / 3 = 34; 400 / 8 = 50)
Dividend smaller than divisor (e.g., 3 / 5 = 0 R 3)
Verify calculations, step-by-step display, explanations, and highlighting for correctness.
Verify control button states and reset functionality.
This detailed plan should provide enough guidance. The junior engineer should tackle one task at a time, focusing on getting the data flow correct first, then the visual representation. Frequent testing and breaking down complex parts (like generateSteps and LongDivisionGridDisplay rendering) into smaller sub-problems will be key.
